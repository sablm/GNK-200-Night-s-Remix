Rewritten MS-GNK code for my GNK-200.

Featured changes (compared to basic GNK-200 firmware)
- Added a pre-rev feature (like on Diana)
- Optimised motors' RPM and solenoid delays for 4S
- Deleted pre-rev switch, blaster now fires after pressing the trigger and waiting for the set delay (250ms from dead stop, and 100ms from pre-rev)
  
Wiring remains the same.
